## Uncommitted

- [ ] One router must freeze each optional prior-committed text chat
  context slice at the session's epoch and source/tenant boundary before
  live ASR. No same-turn LLM feedback loop, cross-tenant history, system
  prompts, raw KV pointers or tool secrets. The ON/OFF config/flag toggle
  leaves typed graph topology stable; the OFF path performs no context
  retrieval. Bound 16KiB UTF-8, credit/backpressure, stale acknowledgements,
  opt-in and privacy/consent, and source-real ASR accuracy/latency tests.

- [ ] Make TOML/repeatable-flag compiled pipeline configs a first-class
  source-bound router input: many model IDs, many typed component DAGs,
  many explicit protocol/route bindings within ONE process; one model
  can serve standalone chat and ASR→diarization→LLM→TTS. Preserve
  direct one-model CLI execution with no config requirement. Current
  pipeline check is pure scaffolding; implement model residency,
  admission, TaskCoordinator execution, generation/hot reload and
  authenticated OpenAI/SSE/WebSocket/WebRTC transport, then enable
  pipeline run/serve only after source/physical tests.
- [ ] Distinguish model-trained MTP weights and Qwen Flash-Next
  learned n-gram embedding bank from runtime n-gram/suffix
  speculative decoding (no extra source required). Verify
  accept/reject and complete rollback/grammar RNG across
  QSA/GDN/MoE before any speed claim.

- [ ] Implement canonical TaskRequest/coordinator workers and CLI/SDK/API integration, model routing/residency lifecycle, explicit supported OpenAI/Anthropic interfaces, streaming/tools/reasoning/schema/sampling and truthful capabilities.
- [ ] Enforce separate API/tenant payload, queued-prefill/residency and physical active-step admission; bounded overload, cancellation, disconnect, stale epochs and output backpressure.
- [ ] Add real compatible continuous/grouped batches, aged chunked prefill, decode/media fairness and finite joint batch/draft/expert/kernel/placement plans; no per-token catalog/JSON/global-lock work.
- [ ] Finish Qwen basics before optimizations; enumerate the complete pinned llama.cpp/vLLM union, public and internal surfaces. Preserve 105 provisional groups/145 document seeds and CLI/API frontiers as unreviewed inputs, not exhaustive parity.
- [ ] Implement every applicable sampler/logits-processor/RNG/logprob/grammar/tool/stop/reasoning composition and its independently verified outputs.
- [ ] Qualify target-authoritative MTP, draft model, n-gram/suffix, EAGLE, DFlash/DFlash2, DSpark and related registered strategies; DSpark2 exact primary source/version remains unresolved.
- [ ] Test all accepted-prefix lengths, target-distribution correction, target/draft RNG/grammar ownership, full KV/recurrent/index/media rollback, physical branch admission and authentic cancellation/quarantine.
- [ ] Jointly benchmark material combinations, adaptive depth/backoff and all offered/rejected/canceled work: committed SLO-goodput, TTFT/ITL tails, fairness, memory and energy versus equivalent pinned vLLM/V1/Omni.
- [ ] Preserve zero untriaged frontier/disposition requirements before any full-parity claim; synthetic acceptance, fewer launches and competitor measurements do not establish local parity or speed.

### 6d74f76

- [x] Shared immutable source, independent StateRoots, bounded fair physical workers and actual completion exist as foundations; production serving/parity/speculation is not complete.
