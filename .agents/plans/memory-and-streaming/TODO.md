# Memory and streaming

Provenance commit: `6d74f76`.
Scope: P03/P05/P07/P10/P12/P16.
Contracts: [unified residency/SSD](../../docs/UNIFIED_VIRTUAL_TENSOR_RESIDENCY_AND_SSD_STREAMING_2026-10-15.md),
[SSD gates](../../research/SSD_STREAMING_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP_AND_ACCEPTANCE_2026-10-15.md),
[large-source admission](../IMMUTABLE_SHARDED_SOURCE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md).

## Uncommitted

- [x] **Verified source-only SSD extent foundation:** original opened
  descriptor, SHA256-pinned complete chunk manifest, checked source
  offsets and per-range hashes, 4MiB chunk/32MiB read bounds,
  coalesced positional file IO and original ResourceArbiter
  transfer-staging admission before allocating/reading. Exact
  byte-window materialization returns immutable leased slices, never
  unsafe borrowed mutable-file views. Tests cover exact reads,
  truncation/hash mutation, path rename, rollback, insufficient
  host memory and sparse >5GiB metadata-only source.
  Six SSD-focused tests pass, and the entire isolated workspace
  gate passes 1,147/0 across 241 Rust suites. The Nix filtered
  source-integrity derivation cannot run offline because the
  pinned nixpkgs flake input is missing (not a source test failure).
  No trained resident-versus-SSD model, device copy or eviction yet.
- [ ] **Next SSD source execution:** source-verified per-tensor
  extent mapping and async I/O/readiness model integrated with
  original CPU/GPU TensorSource and BufferLease, cancellation,
  cache/eviction/ABA and independently trained full-logit/StateRoot
  parity on real large weights.

- [ ] Shared one-process pipeline residency: source-exact immutable
  model/component buffers, per-session private StateRoots, one
  ResourceArbiter (UMA/GPU/RAM/SSD and device queue), cross-model
  lease/zero-copy only when physical placement, codec and lifetime
  permit it. Do not replicate weights per route or release a
  GPU buffer before actual completion/quarantine retirement.
- [ ] Prioritize Qwen3.5 2B resident then Qwen3.8 27B SSD
  streaming and Gemma4 E2B/26B/31B, then sparse Qwen Flash-Next
  learned 51B n-gram bank and 4B MTP head placements. Compare
  source-real logits, resident/streamed StateRoot, cold/warm
  TTFT/ITL, I/O/read amplification and throughput with full
  physical/cancel/error gates; live audio's soft deadline may
  demand resident codecs and refuse cold SSD layouts.

- [ ] Route legacy/new model allocations, CPU state/scratch/staging and APU/GPU shared backing into the same configured physical pools with OS/cgroup headroom; never sum overlapping UMA/VRAM/GTT counters.
- [ ] Implement paged/contiguous state policy and full-domain prefix identity/intersection/COW across KV/SWA/recurrent/indexer/draft/grammar/media state, source/template/adapter and tenant boundaries.
- [ ] Qualify committed snapshot persistence/restore, corruption/security/compatibility UX and restore-versus-recompute; diagnostic portable checkpoints are not product persistence.
- [ ] Add immutable source extents and bounded coalesced IO/materialization with stable logical tensor identity, genuine copy readiness and original IO/device reader leases.
- [ ] Protect encoded-but-unsubmitted/captured expert reads and generation ABA; support mixed-codec expert size classes under one byte cap, source-exact routing and hot-cache preservation.
- [ ] Add bounded PLE/Engram lookup rows and separately governed disk state/media tiers; fully resident execution must incur no mandatory IO or host cache dispatch.
- [ ] Test source-exact resident/streamed parity, short/corrupt IO, cancellation, safe victim refusal, SSD QoS and actual physical lifetime before eviction/free-space claims.
- [ ] Optional direct/async/platform IO needs equivalent semantics and explicit support; large memory-pressure/SSD experiments require approved hardware/source scope.

- [ ] Distinguish logical envelope retirement from driver allocator pages/pools, fragmentation, cross-process use and actual OS release. Driver VRAM/GTT usage/max counters are not reservations or immediately free bytes.
- [ ] Prove trusted teardown/recovery before reclaiming unknown-work handles or clearing a fence. Diagnostic service sync/readback permits inspection/exit only and cannot synthesize Ready, retire unknown events or authorize reuse.

## Committed

### 6d74f76

- [x] Physical arbiter, original GPU leases/quarantine and committed session/checkpoint foundations accepted; global host/UMA, full-state prefix manager and SSD model streaming remain open.

## Tests and verification

- [ ] SSD-01..32: run the [full source/residency suite](../../research/SSD_STREAMING_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP_AND_ACCEPTANCE_2026-10-15.md) for each claimed backing/backend; mock tiers cannot qualify physical IO or trained streaming.
- [ ] SSD-14/15: encoded-but-unsubmitted, queued and captured readers prevent generation-ABA slot reuse through actual GPU completion/cancellation.
- [ ] SSD-21/22/24: mixed Q2/Q4 expert sizes share one byte cap with safe victims and fair progress; hot-cache retention cannot bypass admission.
- [ ] SSD-32: an authorized original trained streamed model matches complete resident logits/StateRoot; measure cold/warm IO, staging, OS headroom and genuine resource lifetime.
