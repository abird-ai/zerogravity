# Memory and streaming

Provenance commit: `6d74f76`.
Scope: P03/P05/P07/P10/P12/P16.
Contracts: [unified residency/SSD](../../docs/UNIFIED_VIRTUAL_TENSOR_RESIDENCY_AND_SSD_STREAMING_2026-10-15.md),
[SSD gates](../../research/SSD_STREAMING_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP_AND_ACCEPTANCE_2026-10-15.md),
[large-source admission](../IMMUTABLE_SHARDED_SOURCE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md).

## Uncommitted

- [ ] Route legacy/new model allocations, CPU state/scratch/staging and APU/GPU shared backing into the same configured physical pools with OS/cgroup headroom; never sum overlapping UMA/VRAM/GTT counters.
- [ ] Implement paged/contiguous state policy and full-domain prefix identity/intersection/COW across KV/SWA/recurrent/indexer/draft/grammar/media state, source/template/adapter and tenant boundaries.
- [ ] Qualify committed snapshot persistence/restore, corruption/security/compatibility UX and restore-versus-recompute; diagnostic portable checkpoints are not product persistence.
- [ ] Add immutable source extents and bounded coalesced IO/materialization with stable logical tensor identity, genuine copy readiness and original IO/device reader leases.
- [ ] Protect encoded-but-unsubmitted/captured expert reads and generation ABA; support mixed-codec expert size classes under one byte cap, source-exact routing and hot-cache preservation.
- [ ] Add bounded PLE/Engram lookup rows and separately governed disk state/media tiers; fully resident execution must incur no mandatory IO or host cache dispatch.
- [ ] Test source-exact resident/streamed parity, short/corrupt IO, cancellation, safe victim refusal, SSD QoS and actual physical lifetime before eviction/free-space claims.
- [ ] Optional direct/async/platform IO needs equivalent semantics and explicit support; large memory-pressure/SSD experiments require approved hardware/source scope.

- [ ] Distinguish logical envelope retirement from driver allocator pages/pools, fragmentation, cross-process use and actual OS release. Driver VRAM/GTT usage/max counters are not reservations or immediately free bytes.
- [ ] Prove trusted teardown/recovery before reclaiming unknown-work handles or clearing a fence. Diagnostic service sync/readback permits inspection/exit only and cannot synthesize Ready, retire unknown events or authorize reuse.

## Committed

### 6d74f76

- [x] Physical arbiter, original GPU leases/quarantine and committed session/checkpoint foundations accepted; global host/UMA, full-state prefix manager and SSD model streaming remain open.
